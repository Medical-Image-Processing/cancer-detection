# Histopathologic Cancer Detection using CNNs

![header](img/header.png)

## Description

"Histopathologic Cancer Detection using CNNs" is developed by Team Capybara ([gsarti](https://github.com/gsarti), [stinco](https://github.com/stinco), [andrealorenzon](https://github.com/andrealorenzon)) as final project for the course "Statistical Machine Learning" held by Prof. Luca Bortolussi at University of Trieste.

The project is based on the Kaggle competition ["Histopathologic Cancer Detection"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection), in which participants create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.

## Data

The data are a slightly modified version of the **PatchCamelyon (PCam)** [benchmark dataset](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam) in which duplicates generated by probabilistic sampling were removed.

> **PCam** packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task, akin to CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Models can easily be trained on a single GPU in a couple hours, and achieve competitive scores in the Camelyon16 tasks of tumor detection and whole-slide image diagnosis. Furthermore, the balance between task-difficulty and tractability makes it a prime suspect for fundamental machine learning research on topics as active learning, model uncertainty, and explainability.
